### Tech stack

Required tech stack:

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3.2+
- Spring Data JPA
- Postgres in a Docker container
- TypeScript
- React 18+ (with functional components)

Everything else is up to you to choose. I recommend Vite for building the frontend project, TanStack Query for handling queries, TanStack Router if you want routing in your SPA, Tailwind, other component libraries for easier styling and reusable components, Maven, Spring Validation, and so on and on.

### Minimum requirements

The bare minimum is a frontend (that doesn't look and feel scary), a web api that serves requests, and a database for storing the data.

Your app needs to have _some_ functionality of _some_ use to _someone_. At the very least, you need some CRUD functionality (as opposed to just displaying something, or just entering something with no purpose).

Feel completely free to use external APIs for cool things.

### Setup and planning

Use your own _public_ repository on _your_ GitHub account.

**DO NOT** start (or, rather, continue) before you have a clear plan of what you're going to do, and a conservative estimate of how long that will take you. Then multiply it by 4, and that is the minimum time it will take you. If it's more than 15 hours, review your plan.

Always have an MVP in mind that represents the minimum set of features your app needs - something you can always fall back to, if you can't implement a desired fantasy feature. Don't start work on extra stuff until you're sure your basic stuff is stable.

Create a readme where you lay out your plan for your project. At the end, add some instructions on how to build and run the whole app to the readme.

Create a project in GitHub projects where you make a plan and track your progress. Create cards that represent your steps.

There should be a high level big-picture sketch of your whole setup (preferably created **before** you're too deep into coding), as well as view mockups for the frontend. You can use any sketching tool (Excalidraw is one). Put the sketches in the project root.

There are also online tools for sketching database schemas. They're helpful. Try them. If you sketch your schema, also include that file in the project.

Be mindful of clean coding, naming standards and conventions, formatting, code organization, layering, and so on.
